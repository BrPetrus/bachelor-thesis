Image processing involves the use of many manthematical techniques and
algorithms to extract useful information or somehow alter the image. The purpose
of this section is to provide a comprehensive and shallow overview of the
fundamental concepts used in my image processing pipeline.

\section{Digital Image}
Our eyesight is undoubtedly one of our most helpful senses, allowing us to
observe, study and comprehend the world around us. However, the way a computer
processes visual information is quite different. To enable us to study the world
using computer, numerous tools and algorithms have been developed. In this
section, I will begind by defining the concept of images in a formalized manner,
so that mathematics and computer science knowledge can be utilized to analyze
images.

Essentially we can think of an image as an n-dimensional function $f(x_1, x_2,
..., x_n)$, where $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ are coordinates inside a spatial domain,
while the function value at those coordinates specifies the magnitude or
intensity of the signal at that point. We can think about images as functions of
type $f:\R^n \rightarrow \R^m$ where $n$ indicates the number of spatial
dimensions and $m$ specifies the number of channels. For example, when we are
talking about two-dimensional greyscale images, $m$ is equal to 1 and $n$ is
equal to 2, while a typical coloured photograph has 3 colour channels. Another
important image type is the binary image, where the function's range is just two
values.

Once we start using computers to work with images, we no longer can work with
real-valued spatial dimensions and intensities, because we only have a finite
number of bits. The process of acquiring images in a finite grid and assigning
intensities from a finite range is called sampling and quantization. In essence,
we create a discretized version of the original signal, which can be represented
as an one- or multi-dimensional array of values. If the coordinates and the
intensity are subsets of some discrete set, then the function represents a
digital image.

\section{Image denoising}

In a perfect world, every image would be sharp and ev
%todo: write some introductiory paragraph

%todo: reword draft
Quite counter-intuitively, to reduce the effect of noise while reading details,
some sort of averaging of the image is performed. How and why a noise ends up in
an image is a vast topic, which is not going to be discussed here in depth.
(\textbf{Consider adding the link to membrane noise analysis.}) 

~~A simple noise
model is as follows:~


\section{Edge detection}

In digital image processing, edges typically separate different regions of
interest from one another. They are essential in digital image processing
as they can be used in many workflows --- such as image segmentation and
classification --- to extract various interesting features and regions
from the image.

There is no authoritative definition of an edge, but it can be thought of as a
set of connected pixels that lie on the boundary between two regions
\cite{gonzalez2002}. Usually, there is a gradual difference in intensities
between two regions, as is shown in Figure \ref{fig:edge_intensities}. It is
hard to define precisely where an edge begins and ends, so the first and the
second derivative of the image is usually calculated and analysed.


\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=6cm]{resources/inkscape/gradient.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Intesity of a signal with an edge.}
    \label{fig:edge_intensities}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Calculating gradient}

The first common way of working out where the edge is located is by looking at
the gradient of the image. The gradient of an image $f(x,y)$ at position $(x,
y)$ is defined as vector
\parencite{gonzalez2002}:
$$\nabla \textbf{f} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    G_x \\
    G_y
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}\\[2ex]
    \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}
\end{bmatrix}$$
The vector gradient represents the rate of change in the image, and it points in
the direction of the maximum rate of change of intensity. Often just the bare
vector is not of interest; instead, the magnitude of the gradient, denoted as
$\nabla f$, is calculated too. Confusingly enough, sometimes this is also called
the gradient in the literature, but here I will differentiate it using the bold
text. Formally it is defined as:
$$\nabla f = \text{mag}(\nabla \textbf{f}) = \sqrt{G_x^2 + G_y^2}$$
where $G_i$ symbolises the gradient in the $i$ axis.

Now the question is how to calculate the $G_x$ and $G_y$ of some digital image.
It is impossible to calculate the partial derivatives using the standard
definition from mathematical analysis because digital images are discrete; thus,
we must use an approximation. Even though using something like the Sobel filter
is very common, in my prototype, a more basic Prewitt filter will suffice.
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| }
            \hline
            -1 & 0 & 1 \\
            \hline
            -1 & \underline{0} & 1 \\
            \hline
            -1 & 0 & 1 \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| }
            \hline
            -1 & -1 & -1 \\
            \hline
            0 & \underline{0} & 0 \\
            \hline
            1 & 1 & 1 \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Prewitt horizontal and vertical mask.}
    \label{table:prewitt}
\end{figure}
The horizontal Prewitt filter for 3x3 region looks like in the Figure
\ref{table:prewitt}.
The underlined 0 indicates the centre and the numbers specify weights in the
neighbourhood of a pixel. Summing them all together we arrive at the horizontal or
vertical approximation of the gradient.

TODO image

\subsection{Laplacian operator}

The second common way of finding edges is using the second derivative, or more
precisely using the Laplacian. For a 2D function $f(x, y)$ the Laplacian is
defines as \parencite{gonzalez2002}:

$$\nabla^2 f = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}$$

However, in the context of digital image processing our signal is discrete;
therefore, a discrete approximation is needed. A fairly standard way is to use
the following approach to calculate the partial second derivative in the $x$
axis:
$$\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = f(x + 1, y) + f(x - 1, y) - 2*f(x, y)$$
and similar in the y axis:
$$\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} = f(x, y + 1) + f(x, y - 1) - 2*f(x, y)$$
Substituting into the prior definition we get the following approximation:
$$\nabla^2 f = f(x+1, y) + f(x-1, y) + f(x, y+1) + f(x, y-1) - 4*f(x,y)$$
To calculate the Laplacian of an image, this formula is applied on each pixel.

    \begin{center}

    \end{center}
    \caption{Effect of noise on signal \parencite{gonzalez2002}}
    \label{fig:edges_noise}
\end{figure}

One of the disadvantages of this approach is the sensitivity to noise. For
demonstration purposes, the effects will be shown in 1D. In Figure
\ref{fig:edges_noise}, the effect of noise is demonstrated. While the original
signal does not look too destroyed, it is impossible to find the correct
zero-crossings. Therefore we have to help the operator by first smoothing the
image. A common approach is to first use Gaussian smoothing; this is sometimes
called a Laplacian of Gaussian operator or a Mexican hat filer. The idea is that
by averaging, we reduce some of the effects of the noise. The Figure \textbf{TODO}
demonstrates this effect.

Since the Laplacian is based on second derivatives, it has the property that
each edge produces a zero crossing. This can be readily utilised to find edges
inside an image. A simple algorithm is to go through the whole image and check
if a particular pixel at a given position is positive while its neighbours are
negative. If this condition is true, we set this position to white in the
resulting image and black otherwise. This creates an TODO. Here another valuable
property of the zero-crossing algorithm can be seen. The produced edges are
thin, and form closed contours.

\section{Thresholding}

\subsection{Otsu method}

The Otsu thresholding method is a popular technique to determine a threshold
value between two classes (usually the foreground and the background). As such,
it works well if the image has a clear bimodal distribution. The main idea of
this approach is to see the problem of finding the threshold as an optimization
problem, where the inter-class variance of the two classes is to be minimized.
For some threshold $t$ we can define the variance as \parencite{otsu1979}:
$$\sigma^2_W = \sigma^2_0 \omega_0 + \sigma^2_1 \omega_1$$  %todo: whats w?
where the weight $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are the probabilities of the two
classes. It can be shown that minimizing the intra-class variance is the same as
maximizing inter-class variance \parencite{otsu1979}. This idea leads to an
efficient algorithm employed by many image processing libraries, such as
scikit-image.

TODO image and histogram

\subsection{Gradient threshold}

Another useful thresholding method is the gradient threshold algorithm. Unlike
many other thresholding algorithms, it does not purely rely on the analysis of
the image's histogram; instead, the threshold is calculated as a weighted sum of
the image's intensities, where the weights are dictated by the magnitude of the
gradient \cite{pb130}.

The idea is that the background tends to be rather uniform compared to the
object in the foreground; hence, the magnitude of the gradient is the greatest
in the foreground, and the edge separating it from the background. That can be
utilized by using the magnitude as the weight in the summing of intensities.
This way the background's intensities play lesser role.

Formally the threshold $a$ is defined as:
$$a = \sum_{u, v} I(u, v) \frac{|\nabla I(u, v)|}{\sum_{i, j} |\nabla(i,j)|}$$
where $I(i, j)$ stands for the image intensity at the $(i, j)$ position.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=8cm]{"resources/demo-gradient-threshold.png"}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Demo of gradient threshold.}
    \label{fig:demo_grad_thresh}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:demo_grad_thresh} an example image is shown. There, the
gradient thresholding algorithm was used to segment the cell from the
background. As can be seen, the magnitude of the gradient is biggest in the
cell; hence, it contributes more to the value of the threshold.

\textbf{TODO: Why this threshold method is useful}

\section{Mathematical morphology}

Mathematical morphology is an area of research studying how to extract valuable
information and how to filter images. Few examples of what mathematical
morphology study are edge-detecting algorithms, finding convex hulls, and image
filtering. In the simplest terms, mathematical morphology looks at images as
sets of numbers and modifies them using structural elements. Those can take many
forms, but their shape varies based on the task we are trying to achieve. The
main use of mathematical morphology in this thesis is to pre- and post-process
image data generated by other image processing methods. First, some basic
operations on binary images are described. Note that this area is vast and still
being actively researched, and I will cover only parts which are helpful later
in my prototype.

In this branch of image processing, we look at the images through set theory
instead of looking at images as discrete-valued functions. In this context, an
image is a subset of 2-D integer space $\Z^2$, which can easily be generalized
to more dimensions. Each element of this subset $(x, y)$ represents a present
pixel at those coordinates in the image. In other words, if we look at an image
as an array of rectangular shape, then each foreground pixel's coordinates will
be included in the set representation.

\subsection{Preliminary}
Before we look at the two main operations --- erosion and dilation --- we have to
define two not-so-common operations on sets which are heavily used in
mathematical morphology.

During the following sections, we need to be able to talk about how to create a
reflection of the image around its origin, as is shown in the figure
\ref{fig:morp_refl}. Reflection is formally defined as \parencite{gonzalez2002}:
$$\hat{B} = \{w | w=-b \text{ , for } b \in B\}$$
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=6.3cm]{resources/morph_reflection.jpg}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Morphological reflection} % todo: replace
    \label{fig:morp_refl}
\end{figure}

While manipulating images we commonly have to move parts of the image around.
In principle, a similar operation, called translation, is defined on sets. The
formal definition of moving a set $A$ by some translation vector $z$ is
\parencite{gonzalez2002}:
$$(A)_z = \{c | c = a + z\text{ , for } a \in A\}$$
The operation is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:morph_translation} where the set
$B$ is moved downwards by a vector $z$.
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=6.3cm]{resources/morph_translation.jpg}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Morphological translation} % todo: Replace
    \label{fig:morph_translation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dilation and Erosion}
Now it is possible to properly define two fundamental operations in the field of
mathematical morphology, upon which many other operations are built. Both of
these operations include a structural element. A structural element is again a
set, but it can be used to describe how far and in which way the operation will
influence the result.


\subsubsection{Dilation}
Intuitively we can think about the dilation operator as a way to dilate spots
inside an image into a bigger space. Formally it is defined as
\parencite{gonzalez2002}
$$A \oplus B = \{z | (\hat{B}_z) \cap A \neq \emptyset\}$$
where $A$ and $B$ are both sets in $\Z^2$.

An example of dilation can be seen in the figure \ref{fig:morph_dilation}, where
two examples are shown. In the first row, we have a square image with a side
length of $d$ and a structuring element whose side length is a fourth of the
original. If we apply the dilation operation on these two images, we get the one
on the right. You can imagine taking the smaller square and gliding it over the
bigger one. If there is an overlap, we can add the centre of the structural
element to the result.

Closer to the mathematical definition, all possible translations are applied to
the structural element and if there is an overlap, we add the centre of the
structural element to the resulting set.

For example, this operation can be used to join disconnected segments in an
image by choosing a large enough structural element. Its size will depend on the
particular example and does not necessarily have to be of regular size.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=6.3cm]{resources/morph_dilation.jpg}i
    \end{center}
    \caption{Morphological dilation (Gonzalez 2002)} % todo: Replace
    \label{fig:morph_dilation}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Erosion}

The next essential operation is erosion. As the name suggests, we use it to
erode parts of the image which we consider unnecessary. An erosion $A \ominus B$
of two sets $A$ and $B$, both part of $\Z^2$ space, is defined as
\parencite{gonzalez2002}: $$A \ominus B = \{z | (B)_z \subseteq A\}$$

Again $A$ can be thought of as an image while $B$ can be looked at as a
structural element. In contrast to the dilation operation, we are now looking if
the whole structural element fits inside $A$ as can be seen in the figure
\ref{fig:morph_erosion}. There a smaller structural element is used to cut away
parts of the bigger square.

As opposed to the dilation, we can use erosion to divide lightly connected
segments, and to erase noise and other unwanted disturbances in an image.

While mathematical morphology is a massive topic of interest to many
researchers, here I will only use the aforementioned operations. They can be
further used to define more operations such as binary opening and binary closing
and can be expanded to include grayscale images; however, I will not be using or
covering them in my thesis.

\section{Segmentation}

\subsection{Watershed algorithm}



\chapter{Image data}

The image data --- of organoids of mammary glands in mice --- was acquired using
a fluorescence microscope. The original data was captured in 2011 by a group of
researchers at (\textbf{TODO}) faculty. The captured specimen is around 500
microns by 500 microns by 80 microns big with a resolution of around 4.3 microns
per pixel.

In fluorescence microscopy, researchers are able to stain specific structures in
their specimen so that wanted structures reemit light when the proper wavelength
is shined upon them. This allows them to capture the density of studied proteins
inside the specimen. In this particular case, the researchers captured the
density of six different proteins, of which two are part of membranes, while the
other four are primarily located inside the cell's nuclei.

The data, totalling around 576 GB, consists of 12 different time steps, where
each step has a size of 1920x1920x388 pixels and six different channels. The
data is stored in numerous TIFF files, and every channel contains grayscale data
with 16 bits per pixel. All visualisations of the data had to be manually
preprocessed before including them in this thesis. Otherwise, it would be hard
to see anything.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=6.3cm]{resources/C3-t006-200-scaled.jpg}

    \end{center}
    \caption{Membraine stained channel and nucleus stained channel}
    \label{fig:data_example}
\end{figure}
In the Figure \ref{fig:data_example} a single slice of the data was taken from
two channels. They are from the same moment of time and from the same place. On
the left one of the proteins forming the membrane is showcased while on the right a
different protein mostly located in nuclei is shown.

\section{Problems with the dataset}

The size of the data and the inherent problems of fluorescence microscopy
provide the main issues in analyzing the data. It is very time consuming to
analyse the whole data set; therefore, all work was done on much smaller slices
of the data. Interesting regions with well lit

\subsection{Noise}

The first problem with the data set is the quality. In most places, the noise is
too strong to try to use it in any analysis.

In the membrane channel, two main problems can be seen seen. To begin, most
membranes do not form connected segments, instead, a part the cell's membrane is
usually missing or it is joined with the neighbouring cell's membrane as can be
seen on the Figure \textbf{TODO}. This complicates the analysis, as different
regions may require different filters to be properly preprocessed. Moreover,
this makes the edge detection much harder, since it relies on the magnitude of
gradient of the image.

Another issue is that the light gets scattred inside the organoid as can be seen
on Figure \textbf{TODO}. That means that it is possible to analyze only the
outer most layers of cells of the organoid.

The protein channel comes with its own set of problems, some of them different.
It is still true, that the sharpest data comes, again, from the outermost layer
of the organoid, limiting the amount of usable data. Another issue is that the
individual cells are sometimes quite fuzzy, which makes it hard to decide, where
exactly the cells ends, or if they are multiple cells.
% todo: reword

\subsection{Size}

The size of the dataset poses the second problem, as it would be computationaly
expensive to try to process the whole data set at once; however a lot of the
data is either unusable or of no interest. In most instances, the data is
predominantly composed of the background, and at several moments in time, no
specimen can be seen; therefore, to reduce the computational demands further,
only specific regions of interest were manually selected to create the final
data set. In the end, the reduced data set is only a few dozen megabytes large.

\chapter{The developed segmentation method}

%todo: inkorporovat fakt, ze hlavne v jadrovom kanale to robime
%note: Overview/Goals;High level overview of the process.

The goal of the algorithm is to segment individual cells and uniquely label each
cell; however, as previously discussed, they are often not clearly separated
from each other. A naive otsu thresholding leads to NEUSPOKOJIVE results as is
seen on Figure \textbf{TODO}. Thus, a more sophisticated algorithm had to be
developed to segment the cells' nuclei finer.

We settled on two step algorithm. In the first step, the membraine-stained
channel is used, while in the second step the nuclei-stained channel is used.
Every cell has a membrane and a nuclei in our specimen; hence, we should be able
to use the information provided by the first channel to improve the thresholding
in the second channel.

In the first step quite DRSNA segmentation is performed to roughly find the
membranes separating the individual cells. The segmentation is then utilized in
the second step; the algorithm overlays the previous segmentation on top of the
protein-stained channel and looks at every label. Each one represents a single
cell, and some of it's surroundings. Finally, a local version of the gradient 
threshold is performed on each region.

\section{Membrane channel}
Steps inside the membrane channel: watershed, thresholding, denoising, edge
detection

The goal is to provide a rough segmentation of the cells using the
membrane-stained channel. First, a pre-process of the data is performed to deal
with some of the noise in the data. As can be seen on Figure \textbf{TODO} we
need to deal with the fact, that the intensity inside the cell is quite uneven.
To even out the lighting inside cells a maximum projection from gaussian pyramid
is performed. The idea behind this step is, that edge have higher intenisties
than insides of the cells; therefore they should not be very influenced by this
step. At the same time the uneven lighting inside cells will be smoothen out,
since the highest intensity areas will \textbf{bleed} out to the surrounding
area. This effect is demonstrated on the Figure \textbf{TODO}. That concludes
the denoising part.

% TODO: rephrase this
Naivelly applying the zero-crossing algorithm results in other artifacts, such
as noise causing the algorithm to find contours in the background; therefore,
a cell mask must be created to differentiate between the foreground (the
specimen) and the background. For this task, the Otsu thresholding method was
used, due to a bimodal distribution of the data \textbf{TODO}. On the Figure
\textbf{TODO} the thresholded data along with the histogram is shown. However,
some of the useful data is incorrectly labeled as background, to combat this, in
a general form a binary erosion with a circular structural element with radius
equal to user-defined cell radius. The final version is show in the second row
in Figure \textbf{TODO}.

After dealing with the uneven lighting the edge detection is performed. To help
with the residual noise, anisotropic gaussian smoothing is applied. The voxel
dimensions in our data is not the same as in the z-axis the voxel is about 2.5
times as large; hence, using an anisotropic filter is more correct. 

Now the pre-processing is finished and the zero-crossing algorithm is applied.
The zero-crossing algorithm provides a reasonable outline of the cells as is
shown in Figure \textbf{TODO}. The user sometimes has to play around with
various sigmas to improve the quality of the edge detection. When the sigma is
too low the algorithm tends to find a large amount of small regions, while too
large sigma causes the algorithm to join individual cells together. This step
is further complicated by the fact, that some of the cells are missing parts of
their membranes. \textbf{TODO}; hence, the is one of the limiting factors of
the segmentation pipeline.

Next step is to utilize the outlines to segment individual cells. For this task
the watershed algorithm is used. To improve the quality of the segmentation,
markers indicating the sources of water need to be created. Ideally, every cell
has one marker. These markers are then fed to the watershed algorithm as places
from which water stems from. To find these markers, the insides of the cells
need to be filled. This is done in two steps using a flood fill algorithm. At
this points, we have a binary image, one value represents edge and the second
everything else. We assume, that the border of the image belongs to the
backgroudn and start a flood fill from the border filling it with a new colour. In
the second step, all areas, which are not edges and were not filled in the first
step are said to be inside of the cells. In Figure \textbf{TODO} all insides of
cells are filled, and everything else is considered to be the background. This
is used to calculate the distance map, from which, finally, the markers are
obtained. The markers are chosen as local extremes from the distance map.
Additionaly, only a subset of the markers are chosen, the constraint being,
that they have to be at least one cell radius apart. The cell radius is
tweakable option. The distance map and the markers are then passed to the
watershed algorithm. It labels each cell with a unique label.

A great advantage of creating the markers from the distance map is that, even if
the edge detections joins several cells together, the two cells can still be
labeled individualy.

\section{Nuclei-stained channel}

Steps inside the protein channel: thresholding, denoising

In Figure \textbf{TODO} a common example of the nuclei-stained channel is shown.
In this channel the preprocessing consists of just a simple gaussian smoothing
to help with the thresholding.

Applying the Otsu thresholding method in the nuclei-stained channel leads to
poor results as is seen in Figue \textbf{TODO}. The problem is that the lighting
is quite uneven. Some cells are significanlty brighter than others; thus, global
thresholding is not a viable option.

However, we can use the previously obtained segmentation from membraine-stained
channel to improve the quality of the thresholding. By looking at just specific
areas denoted by the labels, the thresholding yields more suitable results. In
essence, a local version of some thresholding algorithm can be used.

In our testing, Otsu thresholding method was not suitable as in many cases the
proximity of cells shrinks the background area, causing the algorithm to
categorise some of the foreground as the background. After some experimentation,
we concluded that the gradient thresholdolding algorithm provides better result.
In Figure \textbf{TODO} a comparison is made between these two algorithms. Also
others easily accessed thresholding methods in the scikit library were
experimented with, but the gradient thresholding method provided reasonable
results in many cases.

% todo: tu asi neni jasne, ze sa to robi postupne
Even tough the data was smoothed before applying the threshold, many edges in
the binary thresholded image appear quite jagged, to combat this a final round
of post-processing is applied. It consists of appyling binary morphological
closing on each label to fill in dark spots; thus, rounding of the jagged edges.

An example of the final segmentation and the ground truth --- created by a
biologist --- is shown in Figure \textbf{TODO}. This concludes the section about
how the algorithm works. In Figure \textbf{TODO} several other examples of
segmentations are given.
